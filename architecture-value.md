# The "Senior Editor" Architecture (Our Core Value)

This document outlines the high-value workflow that separates our application from generic "AI wrappers." We are not just building tools; we are digitizing the workflow of a professional Senior SEO Editor.

## Phase 1: The Insight
*Instead of just reading text, we understand it.*

1.  **Extract:** We fetch competitor content using our specialized clean-up logic (removing ads, noise, and junk).
2.  **Analyze:** We don't just dump text. We identify:
    *   **Structure Patterns:** "All top-ranking articles include a 'Pricing Comparison' table."
3.  **Synthesis:** We condense 50 pages of reading into a clear, usable "Knowledge Graph" for the writer.
4.  **Tone Management:** We ensure the tone is consistent and engaging.

## Phase 2: The Director (Context Distribution)

1.  **Angle Selection:** We propose 3 distinct approaches (e.g., "The Ultimate Guide," "The Contrarian View," "The Case Study") so the user can choose the right fit.
2.  **Smart Outlining:** We build a skeleton based on data, not hallucinations. We map specific *facts* to specific *sections*.
3.  **Context Distribution:** We act like a project manager. We give the "Intro Writer" only the background info, and the "Technical Writer" only the specs. No one gets overwhelmed.

## Phase 3: The Writer (Execute without hallucination)
*We solve the "Lost in the Middle" problem.*

1.  **Structured Output:** We ensure the formatting (headers, lists, bolding) is perfect and ready for the web, not just a wall of text.
2.  **Trust Available:** We ensure the writer has all the information they need to write without hallucination.

## Phase 4: The Editor (Refinement & Polish)
*The first draft is never the final draft.*

1.  **Self-Correction:** (Future V2) An automated "Reviewer" pass checks the content against the original plan. "Did we mention the keyword? Is the tone consistent?"
2.  **Interactive Tools:** We give the user "Power Tools" inside the editor (Tiptap) to Rewrite, Expand, or Simplify specific paragraphs instantly.
3.  **Final Polish:** We handle the boring stuff—meta tags, image alt text, and internal linking suggestions.

**Summary:** We are not selling a "Writer." We are selling a **team**: An Analyst, a Strategist, and an Editor, all working together to produce professional results.
